 *     summary: Update product approval status (Admin only)
 *     description: |
 *       Approve, reject, or modify the status of a product listing.
 *       **Admin Access Required**: Only administrators can change product approval status.
 *       **Status Workflow**:
 *       - `pending` → `approved`: Product becomes visible to users
 *       - `pending` → `rejected`: Product is hidden, user can resubmit with changes
 *       - `approved` → `sold`: Mark as sold (removes from active listings)
 *       - `approved` → `inactive`: Temporarily hide (user can reactivate)
 *       
 *       **Audit Trail**: All status changes are logged with admin ID and reason.

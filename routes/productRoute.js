 *       The process:

 *       2. OTP is sent to their phone
 *       3. User calls this endpoint with OTP and product data
 *       4. If OTP is valid, user is verified and product is posted
 *       
 *       **Note:** This is an alternative flow for users who haven't completed phone verification yet.
 *       **Image Handling:** Provide image URLs directly in the request body (no file upload).
